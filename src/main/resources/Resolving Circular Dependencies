# Analysis of Circular Dependencies

## Current Situation

Based on the provided entity classes, we can identify the following relationships:

1. `Users` <-> `Games` (Many-to-Many)
2. `Users` <-> `Stores` (Many-to-Many)
3. `Games` <-> `Stores` (Many-to-Many)
4. `Users` -> `Availability` (Many-to-One)

The circular dependencies are primarily caused by the bidirectional relationships between Users, Games, and Stores.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Use Unidirectional Relationships

One approach is to make some of the relationships unidirectional. This can help break the circular dependencies while still maintaining the necessary associations.

Example:
- Keep the `Users` -> `Games` relationship, but remove the `players` set from the `Games` entity.
- Keep the `Users` -> `Stores` relationship, but remove the `storeUsers` set from the `Stores` entity.

### 2. Use @JsonManagedReference and @JsonBackReference

If you're using Jackson for JSON serialization, you can use these annotations to break the circular references during serialization:

```java
// In Users class
@JsonManagedReference
private Set<Games> userGames;

// In Games class
@JsonBackReference
private Set<Users> players;
```

### 3. Implement Custom Serialization Methods

Override `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods to handle circular references:

```java
@ToString(exclude = {"players", "stores"})
@EqualsAndHashCode(exclude = {"players", "stores"})
public class Games {
    // ...
}
```

### 4. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

Create separate DTO classes for API responses, which don't include the circular references:

```java
public class GameDTO {
    private Long gameId;
    private String name;
    // Other fields, but exclude 'players' and 'stores'
}
```

### 5. Lazy Loading

Ensure that related entities are lazily loaded to prevent unnecessary data fetching:

```java
@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private Set<Games> userGames;
```

### 6. Refactor the Domain Model

Consider if the current model accurately represents your domain. For example, you might introduce a join entity for the Many-to-Many relationships:

```java
@Entity
public class UserGame {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Users user;

    @ManyToOne
    private Games game;

    // Additional fields like 'joinDate', etc.
}
```

This approach can simplify the relationships and provide a place for additional metadata about the association.

## Recommendation

A combination of approaches 3, 5, and 6 would likely be most effective:

1. Implement custom serialization methods to handle circular references.
2. Ensure lazy loading is used for all Many-to-Many relationships.
3. Consider introducing join entities for Many-to-Many relationships, especially if you need to store additional data about the relationship.

These changes will help manage the circular dependencies while maintaining the integrity of your domain model.
